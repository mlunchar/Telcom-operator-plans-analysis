# Telcom-operator-plans-analysis
This project was made as an assignment for Practicum100 Data Analyst course with goal to master Statistical Data Analysis and hypotheses testing.

We're making an analysis for a telecom operator Megaline, our goal is to analyze users' behavior for two plans: Surf and Ultimate, and determine which prepaid plan brings in more revenue.

Project structure:

1. General information. We'll open the data files and study general information in detail.
2. Data Preprocessing. Dealing with missing and duplicate data, changing data types etc.
3. Exploratory data analysis. Uni-variate and bi-variate analysis of the data.
4. Statistical Data analysis. Testing the hypotheses.
5. Overall conclusion.

Additionally:
* The project was made in Jupyter Notebook, so to run it you should have Anaconda installed. It has a Table of Contents for easier navigation.

* When downloaded, the data has to be stored in the same folder with the notebook.

This project was created by Mila Lunacharska, in November 2021.
